Surya's Text to Math Problem Solver & Research Assistant
Overview
This is an AI-powered Math Problem Solver & Research Assistant built using Streamlit and Gradio, leveraging LangChain and Groq's LLM. The application can:

Solve math problems with step-by-step explanations.
Extract and evaluate numerical expressions.
Search Wikipedia for additional context.
Perform reasoning-based calculations.
Accept text-based queries for mathematical problem-solving.
Run on both Streamlit (interactive UI) and Gradio (web-based interface).
Features
✅ Step-by-Step Math Solutions – Detailed explanation for math problems.
✅ Automated Numerical Expression Extraction – Parses and evaluates mathematical expressions.
✅ Wikipedia Search Integration – Fetches additional knowledge for contextual understanding.
✅ Works with Variables – Assumes values if needed and clearly states assumptions.
✅ Dual Interface Support – Available in both Streamlit and Gradio.
✅ Groq LLM Integration – Uses gemma2-9b-it for processing queries.

Tech Stack
Technology	Purpose
Python	Core programming language

Functionality Breakdown
1️⃣ Model Initialization
Loads the Groq API key from the .env file or user input.
Initializes Groq’s LLM (gemma2-9b-it) for processing questions.
2️⃣ Tools & Features
🔢 Math Problem Solver
Extracts numerical expressions from queries.
Assumes default values for variables if unspecified.
Provides step-by-step breakdown of the solution.
📖 Wikipedia Research Tool
Searches Wikipedia for additional mathematical context.
Useful for concept explanations related to the problem.
🧠 Reasoning & Calculation
Uses LangChain’s LLMChain for reasoning-based answers.
If the response lacks a detailed breakdown, it falls back to manual calculations.
Error Handling
❌ Missing API Key → Displays an error and asks the user to enter one.
❌ Invalid Inputs → Warns the user if no valid question is provided.
❌ No Numerical Expression Found → Returns an error message if parsing fails.
❌ Unrecognized Variables → Assumes default values (e.g., k=1) and states the assumption.
